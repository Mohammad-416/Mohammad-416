## Hi, I'm Mohammad

I like building things that mix **backend work, real-time systems, and game development.**
I enjoy working on projects where I get to solve actual problems, experiment with ideas, or just learn something new along the way.

Right now I'm mostly focused on improving as a developer and writing cleaner, more reliable systems.

### What I work with

**Languages:** Go, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, C#

**Backend:** REST APIs, WebSockets, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker

**Frontend:** React, Vite

**Game Dev:** Unity (tools + gameplay)

**ML/AI:** YOLOv8, lightweight analysis models, automation tools

I like real-time communication, parallel processing, dev tools, and anything that makes workflows faster or simpler.

### Some of my projects

**URTC** – real-time collaboration server for Unity/Godot projects

**ReWear** – clothing exchange platform built with React, Django, and PostgreSQL

**cron-scheduler (Go)** – interval scheduler that resumes where it left off

**Verbal Analyst** – chatbot for analysing financial data and generating reports

**Lunar PSR Model** – crater detection + enhancement using YOLOv8 and RetinexFormer
